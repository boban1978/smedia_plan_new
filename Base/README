AbstractDB is a PHP database abstraction layer, objected oriented and 
extensible via driver implementations which extend from a common base class.

This package encapsulates all of the basic functions required by most 
developers without the complexity and/or utter simplicity of many other 
abstraction packages.

Incorporating AbstractDB into your applications is as easy as including a 
single file as such:

include("path/to/abstractdb/abstractdb.class.php");

AbstractDB will handle locating and loading the required driver classes itself.

For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.
For license details see the LICENSE file.
For development history see the CHANGELOG file.

AbstractDB is distributed with a manual generated with phpDocumentor 
(http://www.phpdoc.org) which is available in HTML, PDF and CHM (Windows Help) 
formats. You can find the manuals in the /docs directory.

AbstractDB is an Open Source project. We are always on the lookout for 
developers willing to contribute small amounts of time to the development and 
enhancement of this package, especially in the area of driver development. If 
you would be interested in contributing please feel free to contact us at
